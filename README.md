# 👋 Hi there! I'm @rawmayo

#### ⌨️ Why I code
Although I studied Computer Engineering, I considered myself a self-taught developer. The school only taught us the bare minimum and though it's just the basics I enjoyed coding so I decided to choose this path. 

So far did some minor projects in my local area and some personal projects that I might add to my portfolio someday. 

#### 💡 What I'm currently learning
I'm getting my feet wet with Laravel right now. Started playing with API's and I also plan to learn JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue or Svelte.

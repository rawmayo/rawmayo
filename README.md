# üëã Hi there! I'm @rawmayo

#### ‚å®Ô∏è How I learned to code
I considered myself self-taught. I studied Computer Engineering in college and the first programming language I encountered is C++. We had a programming subject that taught us coding but it was just the basics and we didn't even arrive at the object-oriented part. It was not when I started my OJT that I started to do more coding stuff, our department is tasked with the computer laboratories in school. The school wants a monthly sometimes weekly report every broken machine and a list of spare parts needed for maintenance so our department head thought it might be good if we the OJT people create somekind of web application that records the machines that are broken, needed parts and more. That was when I tried diving to web development, that was also my first time trying PHP and JavaScript. Long story short, finished the application and made me enjoy coding more. 

So far did some minor projects in my local and some personal projects that I might add to my portfolio someday. 

#### üí° What I'm currently learning
I decided to try the backend-development path so I'm getting my feet wet with Laravel right now. Started playing with API's and I also plan to learn JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue or Svelte.

# üëã Hi there! I'm Romeo Leones

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Why coding?
I started coding when I was in college. Made my first app using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. It was nothing great but It made me interested on web development more so I learned the basic fundamentals of programming and the rest is history.

So far did some minor projects in my local area and some personal projects that I might add to my portfolio someday. 

#### üí° What I'm currently learning
Right now I'm trying to understand object-oriented programming and trying to be good at using PHP since it is the most used language in the web. By mastering one language, I won't be having a hard time learning the others. I might also want to give Svelte a go, It's more beginner friendly than React or Angular which has a higher learning curve.
